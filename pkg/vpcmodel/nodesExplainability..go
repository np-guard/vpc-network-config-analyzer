package vpcmodel

// stage 1: vsi to vsi of the same subnet (Adi prefers the definition "vsi to vsi considering only SGs")
//          this is relatively simple since only SG can effect this connection, and SG has only enabling rules

// stage 1:
// input: src and dst, both vsi names in string
// 1. Translate src and dst to Nodes
// 2. Find the ingress and egress rules enabling the connection in the SGAnalyzer struct.
//    specifically, the []*SGRule ingressRules and egressRules contributing to the connection.
//    There are two alternatives of achieving this:
//    a) adding the following functionality:
//      func (sg *SecurityGroup) ConnOfSGRules(src, dst vpcmodel.Node, isIngress bool) []*SGRule/[]uniqueIdsOfSGRules
//      whose functionality is similar to that of
//              func (sg *SecurityGroup) AllowedConnectivity(src, dst vpcmodel.Node, isIngress bool) *common.ConnectionSet
//      and for the most part based on the same code
//    In this case after ParseResourcesFromFile and VPCConfigsFromResources dedicated analysis based on ConnOfSGRules will be performed,
//    and the general connectivity analysis functionality will not be called
//
//    b) Enhancing the structure
//        type ConnectivityResult struct {
//       by adding to it the list of the rules contributing to the connection []*SGRule/[]uniqueIdsOfSGRules
//    In this case in addition to ParseResourcesFromFile and VPCConfigsFromResources, GetVPCNetworkConnectivity will be called
//     after which a dedicated function for collecting the relevant SG rules will be deployed.
//
//  3. Extract the actual sg rules from *SGRule and print as output.
//
//     * pointer to the original rule has to be added to SGRule struct [perhaps the first PR here]

// ToDo:
// Highlevel of handling nacl as lack of connection explanability as well, just to see we will not need to rewrite everything
