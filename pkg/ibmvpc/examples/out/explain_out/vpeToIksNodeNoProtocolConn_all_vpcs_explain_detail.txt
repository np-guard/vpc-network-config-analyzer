Explaining connectivity from 192.168.40.5 to 192.168.0.4 within ky-test-vpc using "protocol: ICMP"
Interpreted source(s): iks-clusterid:1[192.168.40.5]
Interpreted destination(s): iks-node[192.168.0.4]
==================================================================================================

No connections from iks-clusterid:1[192.168.40.5] to iks-node[192.168.0.4] using "protocol: ICMP";
	connection is blocked at egress

Egress: security group kube-r006-d7cfb31a-1d4b-40c8-83df-ce2e6f8f2e57 does not allow connection; network ACL ky-test-edge-acl allows connection
Ingress: network ACL ky-test-private-2-others-acl allows connection; security group kube-clusterid:1 partly allows connection; security group ky-test-default-sg allows connection

Path:
	iks-clusterid:1[192.168.40.5] -> | security group kube-r006-d7cfb31a-1d4b-40c8-83df-ce2e6f8f2e57 |

Path is disabled; The relevant rules are:
	Egress:
		security group kube-r006-d7cfb31a-1d4b-40c8-83df-ce2e6f8f2e57 has no relevant rules
		network ACL ky-test-edge-acl allows connection with the following allow rules
			name: allow-outbound, priority: 1, action: allow, direction: outbound, source: 0.0.0.0/0, destination: 0.0.0.0/0, protocol: all

	Ingress:
		network ACL ky-test-private-2-others-acl allows connection with the following allow rules
			name: allow-traffic-subnet-edge-inbound, priority: 1, action: allow, direction: inbound, source: 192.168.32.0/20, destination: 0.0.0.0/0, protocol: all
		security group kube-clusterid:1 partly allows connection with the following allow rules
			id: id:300, direction: inbound, local: 0.0.0.0/0, remote: 0.0.0.0/0, protocol: ICMP icmp-type: 8
		security group ky-test-default-sg allows connection with the following allow rules
