Explaining connectivity from 192.168.40.5 to 192.168.0.4 within ky-test-vpc using "protocol: ICMP"
Interpreted source: iks-clusterid:1[192.168.40.5]
Interpreted destination: iks-node[192.168.0.4]
==================================================================================================

No connections from iks-clusterid:1[192.168.40.5] to iks-node[192.168.0.4] using "protocol: ICMP";
connection is blocked by egress

Egress: security group kube-r006-d7cfb31a-1d4b-40c8-83df-ce2e6f8f2e57 blocks connection; network ACL ky-test-edge-acl allows connection
Ingress: network ACL ky-test-private-2-others-acl allows connection; security group kube-clusterid:1 allows connection; security group ky-test-default-sg allows connection
