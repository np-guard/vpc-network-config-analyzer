// layoutOverlap is a struct that handle overlapping between lines, and overlapping lines on icons.
// We have two kind of overlapping:
//    1. Lines overlapping - two lines are at the same path (lines that has the same set of (src,dst) )
//    2. Lines that overlap icons
// The way to handle the overlap is to add points to the lines (aka bypass points).
// The detection overlapping is done by holding a 2D matrix, that represents the drawio picture.
// a cell in the matrix represent square of minSize*minSize in the picture.
// The cell hold the information whether:
//    1. there is an icon in the square.
//    2. there is a bypass point in the square
// Handling overlapping is done in three steps:
//    1. update the matrix with the icons locations
//    2. handling pairs of lines sharing the same path -
//       this is done by adding a bypass point to one of the lines, at the middle of the line
//    3. handling lines overlapping  icons - this is done by adding a bypass points to the line, next to the icons
// in both steps 2,3. choosing the bypass point is done in two steps:
//    1. calculate a list of potential bypass points, around the icon, (or around the middle of the line)
//    2. choose the best point, and add it to the line.
