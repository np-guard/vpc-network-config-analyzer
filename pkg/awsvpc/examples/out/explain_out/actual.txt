==============================================================

Connections from r1[10.240.48.198] to q2[10.240.32.122]: TCP dst-ports: 9080

Path:
	r1[10.240.48.198] -> security group GroupId:22 -> network ACL acl1 -> subnet private2 -> 
	subnet private1 -> network ACL acl1 -> security group GroupId:9 -> q2[10.240.32.122]


Details:
~~~~~~~~
Path is enabled; The relevant rules are:
	Egress:
		security group GroupId:22 allows connection with the following allow rules
			Outbound index: 0, direction: outbound, target: 0.0.0.0/0, protocol: tcp, dstPorts: 9080-9080
		network ACL acl1 allows connection with the following allow rules
			ruleNumber: 20, action: allow, direction: outbound, cidr: 10.240.32.0/19, protocol: all

	Ingress:
		network ACL acl1 allows connection with the following allow rules
			ruleNumber: 20, action: allow, direction: inbound, cidr: 10.240.32.0/19, protocol: all
		security group GroupId:9 allows connection with the following allow rules
			Inbound index: 0, direction: inbound, target: 10.240.0.0/18, protocol: all

TCP response is enabled; The relevant rules are:
	Egress:
		network ACL acl1 allows connection with the following allow rules
			ruleNumber: 20, action: allow, direction: outbound, cidr: 10.240.32.0/19, protocol: all

	Ingress:
		network ACL acl1 allows connection with the following allow rules

No connectivity from r1[10.240.48.198] to q1[10.240.32.91];
	connectivity is blocked since traffic patterns allowed at ingress are disjoint from the traffic patterns allowed at egress.
	allowed egress traffic: TCP dst-ports: 9080, allowed ingress traffic: UDP

Egress: security group GroupId:22 allows connection; network ACL acl1 allows connection
Ingress: network ACL acl1 allows connection; security group GroupId:15 allows connection
